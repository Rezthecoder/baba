One list is for 176 visas and one is for 475 visas. 475 visas are mostly regional visas away from Metropolitan centres of the state.<br \/>\nSo if your occupation is present on the 475 list of a state, then you can only apply for 475 visa. If your occupation is listed on the 176 list of a state then you can only apply for 176 visa.<br \/>\nPlease note that 475 is a temporary 3 years work visa where as 176 is a permanent visa. Both of them require 100 points to qualify.<br \/>\nHere is a list of state\/territories offshore 176 and 475 visas. The same applies for onshore 886 and 487 visas.<br \/>\nVictoria 176 list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.liveinvictoria.vic.gov.au\/digitalAssets\/1377_Skilled%20Sponsored%20176%20Eligibility%20List.pdf<\/p>\n<p>Victoria 475 list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.liveinvictoria.vic.gov.au\/digitalAssets\/1365_Skilled%20Regional%20Sponsored%20Eligibility%20list%20.pdf<\/p>\n<p>WA 176 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.migration.wa.gov.au\/media\/documents\/priority-skills-list.pdf<\/p>\n<p>WA 475 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.migration.wa.gov.au\/media\/documents\/skills-in-demand-list.pdf<\/p>\n<p>QLD 176 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.workliveplay.qld.gov.au\/dsdweb\/v4\/apps\/web\/content.cfm?id=3709<\/p>\n<p>QLD 475 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.workliveplay.qld.gov.au\/dsdweb\/v4\/apps\/web\/content.cfm?id=3710<\/p>\n<p>NSW 176 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.business.nsw.gov.au\/migration\/state_independent_migration.asp<\/p>\n<p>NSW 475 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.business.nsw.gov.au\/migration\/pdfdocuments\/Skills_In_Demand.pdf<\/p>\n<p>NT 176 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.migration.nt.gov.au\/documents\/STNI_Shortage_List.pdf<\/p>\n<p>NT 475 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.deet.nt.gov.au\/employment\/workforce_nt\/docs\/nt_occupation_shortage_list.pdf<\/p>\n<p>TAS 176 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.development.tas.gov.au\/migration\/Skilled%20Sponsored%20visa%20list%2022-7-08.pdf<\/p>\n<p>TAS 475 visa list<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.development.tas.gov.au\/migration\/Skilled%20Regional%20Sponsored%20Visa%20List%2022-7-08.pdf<\/p>\n<p>SA 176 Visa<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.immigration.sa.gov.au\/pdfs\/gsm\/OccupationList_Permanent.pdf<br \/>\nSA 475 Visa<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.immigration.sa.gov.au\/pdfs\/gsm\/OccupationList_Provisional.pdf<br \/>\nJunaid<\/p>\n<p>Migration Agent Registration Number: 0964018<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/blogspot\/cGmbS\/~3\/myP9uCKv-Nk\/difference-between-visa-176-and-visa.html\">Source link<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article is for those who are interested in applying for 176, 886, 475 or 487 visas.
