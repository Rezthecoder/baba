You can do it yourself but there is a possibility you may miss something by not speaking with the experts first.<\/p>\n<p>International Student Support<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re like thousands of others each year, you may have arrived in Australia after having been to one of our offices in their home country. What\u2019s important to know is that even though your course may have started, there are people here in your local BABA Education office who care just as much about you as your counsellor did in your home country when you first applied for your course.<\/p>\n<p>This way of treating our students is what makes us different. We know that being away from home, family and friends can be tough, so we try our best to make our students feel at ease through the ups and downs of studying in Australia.<\/p>\n<p>Visa Services<\/p>\n<p>We understand that applying for an Australian visa can be stressful and confusing, which is why we have a range of visa services to make it much easier for you.<\/p>\n<p>If you prefer to manage your own application and just need some advice, our counsellors can guide you. If your needs are a little more complex, or prefer for the full process to be looked after for you, our in-house migration agents can step in and help with your full application.<\/p>\n<p>DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, we can help.
